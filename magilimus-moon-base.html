Although the episode idea was scrapped, this specific room remained as a small twist. Since most rooms greet the player with enemies immediately, here I try to set up a scary environment, just so the player ends up locked with hellish spawn on a dark room, while also telling a story of how the invasion was started. </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://matthelm98b.github.io/Mattklirp.github.io/media/posts/2/pentagramroom.gif" alt="" width="800" height="500"></figure><p><strong><br>Punching a (3D) brick wall</strong></p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://matthelm98b.github.io/Mattklirp.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Screenshot_Doom_20250731_191550.png" data-size="1680x987" data-gall="galleryGroup-3"><img loading="lazy" src="https://matthelm98b.github.io/Mattklirp.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Screenshot_Doom_20250731_191550-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="720" height="423"></a></figure></div></div><p>Throughout the making of the map, one of the most frustrating and time-consuming parts was connecting the start of the map with the other half I already had at that moment. Many rooms were conceptualized and tested, but none felt organic enough for the map’s flow. Then I had the idea of applying 3D floors, something I experimented with a bit in Zero Point but did not yet have enough knowledge to use effectively. With this piece, I successfully created a hub with a good 3D feel that didn’t feel dull.</p><p>Even though a blockout pipeline was applied, as the scope of the map grew over time, experimenting and gathering reference became crucial. Pauses in development became normal due to creative blocks regarding both level design and the visual identity of each section of the map, and this specific room was one of the most prominent reasons why. </p><p><strong><br>Big Secrets</strong></p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://matthelm98b.github.io/Mattklirp.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Screenshot_Doom_20251106_120954.png" data-size="1680x987" data-gall="galleryGroup-4"><img loading="lazy" src="https://matthelm98b.github.io/Mattklirp.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Screenshot_Doom_20251106_120954-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="720" height="423"></a></figure></div></div><p>As mentioned, the scope had to be reduced, but after designing one of the secret alternate routes, I came up with this outdoor environment that turned into a large secret area that only the most attentive players would discover. In my first map, I had designed an alternate way to progress, but the area was still accessible even if the secret was not found. In this map, the large outdoor structure containing two major rewards (a health upgrade sphere and the most powerful weapon, respectively) was a decision meant to make players pay close attention to hidden switches and greatly reward those curious enough to find them.</p><p>One thing I am not afraid of is making content the player may never find. Something that brings more flavor to the experience, which old maps that veterans still hold dear to this day have on their design. </p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://matthelm98b.github.io/Mattklirp.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Screenshot_Doom_20251106_221313.png" data-size="1680x987" data-gall="galleryGroup-5"><img loading="lazy" src="https://matthelm98b.github.io/Mattklirp.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Screenshot_Doom_20251106_221313-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="720" height="423"></a></figure></div></div><p><strong><br>Rushing Hour</strong></p><p>When it became clear that I was spending too much time on this project, I set a final deadline and wrapped up what was necessary. At that time, I had to scrap a large portion of a blockout that would have taken too long to refine. I reused the same concept as in my first map but executed it differently. Visuals, layout adjustments, and enemy placements in other sections had to be addressed. I’ll admit the last two rooms aren't the best designed for various reasons, but in my opinion they served their purpose.</p><p>Magilimus Moon Base was received much better than Zero Point due to its significant improvements in both design and visuals. It was a big milestone for me personally and gave me even more knowledge than when I made Zero Point. There was a lot of learning and frustration along the process, but this experience made it possible for me to move towards my next step... Unreal Engine 5 and developing in a game industry environment. </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on November 10, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://matthelm98b.github.io/Mattklirp.github.io/zero-point-zero-pointzip-140kb.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://matthelm98b.github.io/Mattklirp.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/Screenshot_Doom_20240717_231657-xs.png" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="987" width="987"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> Zero Point</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://matthelm98b.github.io/Mattklirp.github.io/paula-the-opossum.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Paula the Possum - Level Design</div><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://matthelm98b.github.io/Mattklirp.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/HighresScreenshot00019-xs.png" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1944" width="1944"></figure></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>                        </p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://matthelm98b.github.io/Mattklirp.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://matthelm98b.github.io/Mattklirp.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
