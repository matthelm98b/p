The creative freedom and attitude among the developers is amazing, and this allowed me to learn the tools to make a level blockout within a month. </p>

<p>I created the blockout of one of the maps by following a premade concept with a vista, using Landscape and Scythe, which is a level design plugin based on Valve's Hammer Editor. It took me some time to get used to the tools and understand how movement and mechanics worked in order to properly apply them to the blockout.</p>
<p>First stage of the blockout - Vista with a delimited explorable area.</p>

                    <p>Magilimus Moon Base, my second official Doom map, has a lot of story behind its production. It took much longer to be made mainly due to scope problems (about one year of production since its conception). Initially, the map had a huge scope and I had to trim it down so I wouldn’t be overwhelmed by its complexity, but in the end things just changed shape and not necessarily volume. The objective with this map was to apply everything I learned from the first and change the formula a bit. </p>

<p>The Pentagram Room was one of the aspects each map of my planned episode was going to have, a thematic piece to give the player a sense of connectivity between every instance of the episode. Although the episode idea was scrapped, this specific room remained as a small twist. Since most rooms greet the player with enemies immediately, here I try to set up a scary environment, just so the player ends up locked with hellish spawn on a dark room, while also telling a story of how the invasion was started. </p>

<p><strong><br>Punching a (3D) brick wall</strong></p>
<div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3">
<figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://matthelm98b.github.io/p/media/posts/2/gallery/Screenshot_Doom_20250731_191550.png" data-size="1680x987"><img loading="lazy" src="https://matthelm98b.github.io/p/media/posts/2/gallery/Screenshot_Doom_20250731_191550-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="720" height="423"></a></figure>
</div></div>
<p>Throughout the making of the map, one of the most frustrating and time-consuming parts was connecting the start of the map with the other half I already had at that moment. Many rooms were conceptualized and tested, but none felt organic enough for the map’s flow. Then I had the idea of applying 3D floors, something I experimented with a bit in Zero Point but did not yet have enough knowledge to use effectively. With this piece, I successfully created a hub with a good 3D feel that didn’t feel dull.</p>
<p>Even though a blockout pipeline was applied, as the scope of the map grew over time, experimenting and gathering reference became crucial. Pauses in development became normal due to creative blocks regarding both level design and the visual identity of each section of the map, and this specific room was one of the most prominent reasons why. </p>
<p><strong><br>Big Secrets</strong></p>
<div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3">

</div></div>
<p>As mentioned, the scope had to be reduced, but after designing one of the secret alternate routes, I came up with this outdoor environment that turned into a large secret area that only the most attentive players would discover. In my first map, I had designed an alternate way to progress, but the area was still accessible even if the secret was not found. In this map, the large outdoor structure containing two major rewards (a health upgrade sphere and the most powerful weapon, respectively) was a decision meant to make players pay close attention to hidden switches and greatly reward those curious enough to find them.</p>
<p>One thing I am not afraid of is making content the player may never find. Something that brings more flavor to the experience, which old maps that veterans still hold dear to this day have on their design. </p>

<p><strong><br>Rushing Hour</strong></p>
<p>When it became clear that I was spending too much time on this project, I set a final deadline and wrapped up what was necessary. At that time, I had to scrap a large portion of a blockout that would have taken too long to refine. I reused the same concept as in my first map but executed it differently. Visuals, layout adjustments, and enemy placements in other sections had to be addressed. I’ll admit the last two rooms aren't the best designed for various reasons, but in my opinion they served their purpose.</p>
<p>Magilimus Moon Base was received much better than Zero Point due to its significant improvements in both design and visuals. It was a big milestone for me personally and gave me even more knowledge than when I made Zero Point. There was a lot of learning and frustration along the process, but this experience made it possible for me to move towards my next step... Unreal Engine 5 and developing in a game industry environment. </p>

<p>The level structure at the start was unclear, but following the standard corridor-room-corridor-room flow and including reachable outside areas guided me through the process. The themes of each room vary between personnel accommodations, tech labs, nukage chambers, and more. Being a beginner, I had almost no specific plan for each room at first, so despite having a concept, most of the rooms were iterated separately without properly considering the organic flow of the map. I simply applied landmark pieces of level design that made each room unique in its own way, so there is a bit of everything all around.</p>
<div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3">

</div></div>
<p>The visual part was, if not equally, even more challenging than the level design. Trying to be pixel-perfect and experimenting with different textures took a large amount of time due to the limitations of the format I initially chose, which affected the level design considerably. Later in the project, the format (Doom) was changed to another with much more freedom (UDMF) for texturing. The monsters were also filtered to better fit each room’s theme, more tech and humanoid monsters in the tech bases, and the more hellish kinds in places where dangerous experiments took place.</p>

</div></div>
<p>All things considered, the map received good reviews, especially considering it was made by someone completely new to the field. The map is not recognized for its difficulty, but rather as a love letter to the original Doom levels. I consider it a good success in those regards, especially coming from a community of seasoned veterans and creators of all types and calibers.</p>
